      const multiply = (n1, n2) => {
        console.log(n1*n2);

      // 7. Write a function `greaterThanThree(n)` which logs "Yes" to the console if a n is greater than three. *Hint:* You will need to use the `>` comparison operator and a conditional statement inside your function.

      const greaterThanThree = (n) => {
        if(n>3){
          console.log(`${n} is greater than 3`);
