    // EXERCISE 1:
    // Create a variable to hold the user input from the prompt.
    // const favoriteFood = prompt("What is your favorite food?");
    // // console.log this sentence into the console:
    // // "My favorite food is -----." using the answer from the prompt
    // console.log(`My favourite food is ${favoriteFood}`);

    // EXERCISE 2:
    // Create a variable with the starting value of 0.
      let cookies = 0;
    // Add 1 to the current value of that variable,
      cookies++;
    // Log this sentence into the console:
    // "I baked a cookie. Now I have -- cookie."
      console.log(`I baked a cookie. Now I have ${cookies} cookie`);
      
    // Subtract 1 from the current value of the variable,
      cookies--
    // then (once again) re-assign the new value to the same variable.
    // Log this sentence into the console:
    // "I just ate a cookie. Now I have -- cookies left."
      console.log(`I just ate a cookie. Now I have ${cookies} cookies left`);
