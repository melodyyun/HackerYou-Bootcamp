	<p>I’m super passionate, <strong>very</strong> about design, development, and business. I’ve been <em>very fortunate</em> to be able to do all three as a career.</p>
	
	<p>From a technical standpoint, I spend most of my time working with JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5 and PHP. I’ve been a WordPress
		developer for 5 years now and over the past year have been working a lot with HTML5, NodeJS and many sprinkles of CSS3.
		New and open sources web technologies make me super excited and I can’t wait to see whats to come of the web in the next
		few years.</p>
	
	<p>I learn from the community and love to share what I have learned back. I regularly have speaking events on everything from
		HTML5 to UI/UX. I’m part of the amazing Ladies Learning Code where I instruct the WordPress courses.</p>
